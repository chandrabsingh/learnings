    "  - Then, your code will continue from where it left off each time for uses the generator.\n",
    "  - When f123() is called, it does not return any of the values in the yield statements! It returns a generator object. Also, the function does not really exit - it goes into a suspended state. When the for loop tries to loop over the generator object, the function resumes from its suspended state at the very next line after the yield it previously returned from, executes the next line of code, in this case, a yield statement, and returns that as the next item. This happens until the function exits, at which point the generator raises StopIteration, and the loop exits.\n",
    "  - So the generator object is sort of like an adapter - at one end it exhibits the iterator protocol, by exposing \\_\\_iter\\_\\_() and next() methods to keep the for loop happy. At the other end, however, it runs the function just enough to get the next value out of it, and puts it back in suspended mode.  \n",
